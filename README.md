# websocket

Small example of using websocket technology to transfer json objects between server and clients.

Build the project with `./gradlew clean build`, then deploy it on a server like glassfish or tomcat, open three Browser instances and call

`http://localhost:8080/websocket-1.0/`

Try to change the status code and save it and see the results in all opened Browsers.

Enjoy it !
